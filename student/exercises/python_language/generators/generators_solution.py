Generators
----------

Generators are created by function definitions which contain one or
more yield expressions in their body.  They are a much easier way to
create iterators than by creating a class and implementing the
__iter__ and next methods manually.

In this exercise you will write generator functions that create
various iterators by using the yield expression inside a function
body.

Create generators to

1. Iterate through a file by reading N bytes at a time; i.e.::

        N = 10000
        for data in chunk_reader(file, N):
            print len(data), type(data)

   should print::

        10000 <type 'str'>
        10000 <type 'str'>
        ...
        10000 <type 'str'>
        X <type 'str'>

   where X is the last number of bytes.

2. Iterate through a sequence N-items at a time; i.e.::

        for i, j, k in grouped([1,2,3,4,5,6,7], 3):
            print i, j, k
            print "="*10

   should print (note the last number is missing)::

        1, 2, 3
        ==========
        4, 5, 6
        ==========


3. Implement "izip" based on a several input sequences; i.e.::  

        list(izip(x,y,z))

   should produce the same as zip(x,y,z) so that in a for loop izip and zip
   work identically, but izip does not create an intermediate list.
